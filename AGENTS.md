# Repository Guidelines

## Development
- This project is a React + TypeScript application built with Vite.
- Use two spaces for indentation.
- Prefer single quotes for strings.
- Do **not** use semicolons at the end of statements.

## Checks
- Install dependencies with `npm install` if `node_modules` is missing.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before committing. These may fail if dependencies are missing but should still be executed.

## Version Control
- Commit messages must be in English and describe the change briefly.
- Do not commit build artifacts such as the `dist` directory.

## Pull Requests
